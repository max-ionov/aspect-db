  - title: Search for aspect pairs
    details: "Slavic aspect is difficult: forms that correspond to a perfective aspect can be formed 
    in a myriad of ways, and there is generally no way to predict how to derive it from a form of the imperfective aspect.
    Our service helps find the right form."
  - title: Explore prefixes
    details: "Many words in Slavic languages form their aspect pairs using prefixes.
    With this service you can inspect which verbs use which prefixes.
    This can be useful both for students and language scholars."
